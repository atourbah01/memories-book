# memories-book
"A quiet, interactive storybook where moments are gathered with care, memories become pages, and feelings are allowed to exist without explanation."  This project is a React-based web application that explores memory-driven storytelling through interactive design. It focuses on narrative flow, smooth transitions, and modular components to create a digital storybook experience where moments unfold gradually, page by page.
